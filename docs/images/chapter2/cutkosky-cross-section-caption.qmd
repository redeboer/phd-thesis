Differential cross </span class="nowrap">sections&nbsp;$\mathrm{d}\sigma/\mathrm{d}\Omega$</span> for three different pion–nucleon scattering processes at the backward scattering </span class="nowrap">angle&nbsp;($\theta=180^\circ$).</span> Shown are two fitted solutions based on amalgamated data from several pion–proton scattering experiments.
