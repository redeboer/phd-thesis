Relative intensity difference between the default model for $\varLambda_c^+ \to p K^- \pi^+$ in the helicity basis and the same model in <span class="nowrap">$LS$&nbsp;basis.</span> The intensities of the LS&nbsp;model are normalised by divided by the sum of the intensities of the default model. For each point of the Dalitz plane, the difference between these normalised intensities is computed and divided over the maximum intensity value of the default model.
